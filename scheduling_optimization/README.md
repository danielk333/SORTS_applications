# Scheduling optimization using SORTS

This is a simple example of scheduling optimization using a parametrized schedule construction for tracking a single object. Much more advanced algorithms with catalog maintenance of thousands of objects is possible using a very small number of controlling parameters. With such a setup, one can apply the same cost-function minimization as applied here to optimize that scheduler.

When the aim is to develop such schedulers, this framework can be used as a starting point for construction.

To run: ```python main.py```.
